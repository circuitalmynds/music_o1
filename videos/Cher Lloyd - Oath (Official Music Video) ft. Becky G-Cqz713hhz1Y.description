Lyrics:

Laughing so damn hard
Crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we share
I promise, I swear

Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you

Oh ohh, I'll never let you go
Oh ohh, whoa, this is my oath to you
Oh ohh, just thought that you should know
Oh ohh, whoa, this is my oath to you"
